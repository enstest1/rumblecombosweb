# RumbleWindows - Solutions and Implementation Notes

## Project Structure and Setup

We've successfully scaffolded the project with the following structure:

- **RumbleWindows/** - Root directory
  - **apps/api/** - Backend Express API
    - **src/controllers/** - API controllers for handling requests
    - **src/middleware/** - Express middleware (logger, error handling, rate limiting)
    - **src/routes/** - API routes
    - **src/services/** - Business logic services with in-memory storage
    - **uploads/** - Created dynamically for temporary file storage
  - **apps/web/** - Frontend React App
    - **public/** - Static assets and PWA manifest
    - **src/assets/** - Application assets
    - **src/components/** - Reusable React components
    - **src/lib/** - Utilities and API client
    - **src/pages/** - Page components

## Backend Implementation

The backend follows the Routes → Controllers → Services pattern as specified in the PRD:

1. **Express Server Setup**:
   - Configured with proper CORS to allow requests from the frontend origin (http://localhost:5173)
   - Implemented middleware for logging using Winston
   - Set up error handling middleware
   - Ensures the uploads directory exists at runtime

2. **API Routes**:
   - Mounted at `/api/v1`
   - Configured multer for file uploads with proper Windows-compatible path handling using `path.join`
   - Implemented song, analysis, and combo endpoints as specified
   - Added rate limiting with specific limits for upload endpoints

3. **Services with In-Memory Storage**:
   - `SongService`: Manages song metadata in a Map
   - `AnalysisService`: Handles music analysis and temporary file deletion
   - `ComboService`: Generates and manages boxing combinations

4. **Music Analysis Implementation**:
   - Simulated BPM analysis for the MVP
   - Simulated energy analysis for the MVP
   - Implemented proper cleanup of temporary files after 5 minutes

5. **Testing**:
   - Added unit tests for SongService and ComboService
   - Configured Vitest for test running and coverage

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - `FileUpload`: Handles drag-and-drop file uploads with validation
   - `AnalysisResultsDisplay`: Shows BPM and energy profile
   - `ComboCard`: Displays individual combos with copy and regenerate functionality
   - `ComboList`: Manages the list of generated combos

2. **Page Components**:
   - `HomePage`: Upload interface and instructions
   - `AnalysisPage`: Displays analysis results and combos with polling for status updates

3. **API Integration**:
   - Created a `apiClient.ts` that follows the Feather interface signature
   - Properly handles FormData for file uploads
   - Implements retry logic for failed requests

4. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**:
   - Responsive layout that works down to 375px width
   - Energy level color coding (green/yellow/red)
   - Visual representation of energy segments

## Windows Compatibility

Ensured Windows compatibility by:

1. Using `path.join` for all file paths
2. Creating directories with `fs.mkdirSync` and recursive option
3. Configuring the backend to use relative paths that work on Windows
4. Avoiding any WSL/Linux-specific commands or paths

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies and Run Tests**:
   - Run `npm install` in the RumbleWindows directory
   - Run `npm install` in the apps/api directory
   - Run `npm install` in the apps/web directory
   - Run `npm test` in the apps/api directory to verify the service tests pass

2. **Complete the Implementation**:
   - Implement actual music analysis using music-tempo and meyda libraries
   - Add more unit tests to reach 80% coverage
   - Enhance frontend components with additional styling and error handling

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Run the application with `npm run dev` in the root directory
   - Test the upload flow with MP3 files
   - Test the analysis and combo generation functionality
   - Test the regenerate combo functionality

## Implementation Notes

- The implementation uses in-memory storage as specified for the MVP
- Files are automatically cleaned up after analysis
- Both backend and frontend are properly typed with TypeScript
- The API client follows the Feather interface pattern for all requests
- The ESLint configuration is set up for both frontend and backend
- Tests are added for core service functionality
